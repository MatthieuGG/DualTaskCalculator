# Dual Task Calculator

```

Automatically calculates the cognitive-motor dual-task effects (DTE) or progress (DTP) from the cognitive and motor performances of subjects at two times (T1 and T2), both realised in single and dual task condition (ST and DT). Can also provide information about the realibility of the measure. 

**Dual-Task Effect**  
Use [this file structure](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/samples/testDTE.csv), and [this part](https://dualtaskcalculator.streamlit.app/~/+/Dual_Task_Effect) of the app. You will obtain this kind of results:  
![Dual Task Effect Graph](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/samples/plot_DTE.png?raw=true)  

`Participant Subject 1: Dual Task Effect (DTE) = Mutual facilitation`  
(etc. for all participants) 

**Dual-Task Progress**  
Use [this file structure](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/samples/testDTP.csv), and [this part](https://dualtaskcalculator.streamlit.app/~/+/Dual_Task_Progress) of the app. You will obtain this kind of results:  
![Dual Task Progress Graph](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/samples/plot_DTP.png?raw=true)  

`Participant Subject 1: went from Mutual facilitation at T1, to Cognitive priority tradeoff at T2, with a DTP -/- : mutual increase of CMI`  
(etc. for all participants)  

You can download the results as CSV and PNG files.  


**Dual-Task Repro**  
Use [this file structure](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/samples/testDTR.csv), and [this part](https://dualtaskcalculator.streamlit.app/~/+/Dual_Task_Repro) of the app. You will obtain this kind of results:  
![Dual Task Repro Graph](https://github.com/MatthieuGG/DualTaskCalculator/blob/main/images/DTR.png?raw=true)  

You can download the results as CSV and PNG files.
