# Dual Task Calculator

Automatically calculates the cognitive-motor dual-task effects (DTE) or progress (DTP) from the cognitive and motor performances of subjects at two times (T1 and T2), both realised in single and dual task condition (ST and DT).  

You obtain this kind of results:  

**Dual-Task Effect**

`Participant Subject 1: Dual Task Effect (DTE) = Mutual facilitation`  
(etc. for all participants) 

**Dual-Task Progress**

`Participant Subject 1: went from Mutual facilitation at T1, to Cognitive priority tradeoff at T2, with a DTP -/- : mutual increase of CMI`  
(etc. for all participants)  

You can download the results as CSV and PNG files.
